## Backend

## The data
The data this project uses is downloaded from [stat.fi](https://www.stat.fi/org/avoindata/pxweb.html), the official source of statistics for Finland. They have a pretty good free API, if you know how to use it. 

## GeoJSON
The GeoJSONs this project uses are courtesy of [this nice person](https://dataist.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/finnish-regional-geodata-as-geojson-and-kml/). On the website it says "Feel free to use them", so I did. Thank you.
